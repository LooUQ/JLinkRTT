# SEGGER J-Link RTT Support in Visual Studio Code Arduino

Segger J-Link RTT is a facility to support low-impact, data I/O from embedded application under test to a debugging host. This library is a direct fork of the Segger published J-Link RTT library, minimally restructured for easy inclusion in Arduino platform projects.
